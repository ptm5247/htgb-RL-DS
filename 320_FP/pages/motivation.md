It may seem trivial, but the first thing you need to figure out before starting a project is what
the general goal is. Why are you doing science on this data? What are you hoping to find, and what
could the potential benefits of your results be?

## The Goal

I want to analyze statistics of Rocket League replay files to see what qualities of someone's
playstyle are most effective on the field. Specifically, I will be looking at a selection of match
statistics from players of all skill levels in order to gain insight on the following question:
*What are the most important aspects of gameplay a player should be focusing on during a match?*

## The Benefit

Many players are constantly wondering, *what is the best way to rank up?* In a game in which you
have full, 3-dimensional control of your vehicle, the skill ceiling is infinite. How, then, do you
pick what to work on next? Perhaps the most effective way to train is to go back and analyze
replays of your own gameplay and identify certain types of scenarios in which you are consistently
performing poorly, and work on fixing those kinds of mistakes. Therefore, the best way to improve
will be slightly different for everyone. However, in this project I hope to identify specific
aspects of gameplay that are most strongly correlated with good performance. By looking for trends
that exist at all skill levels, I hope to be able to provide some sort of insight to players of any
rank about what to keep in mind during both gameplay and training.
