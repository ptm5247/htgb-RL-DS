Now that you've tidied everything that needs tidying and considered everything that needs
considering, it's finally time to start looking for correlations in your data! As you do so, it is
important to consider the assumptions associated with that specific correlation. If those
conditions are not satisfied, you may need to apply some sort of transformation to your data or
explore a different kind of correlation. For this project, I will be looking for linear
relationships (with or without transformations) and will be performing linear regressions. So, what
are the assumptions that I am making?
